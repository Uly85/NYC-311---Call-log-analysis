# NYC-311---Call-log-analysis

**Problem statement**

NYC 3-1-1 is a service channel that allows New Yorkers to access government services and to file complaints via multiple platforms, such as phone calling, texting and other social media (About NYC311).
The number of 3-1-1 calls made in New York City has increased every year since 2012 with millions of unique calls being made each year [1]. It is important to note that the wait time of the service has been increasing over the last few years going from 15 seconds in 2016 to 33 seconds in 2020. Our client, the New York City Municipal Government, wants to introduce automations calls to improve the efficiency of service requests.
Our client provided a huge amount of calling data. For each call, it includes a wealth of information including the reason for the call, caller location, time of day, and so on. However, it is not readily usable in an unstructured format. Since not all service calls can apply automation, we need to create a well structured database to help our client identify the suitable service requests to apply automation. With the new database, they can make more efficient decisions to allocate their resources by service channel type, location, and so on. New Yorkers could also benefit from a faster service response and better service experience.

**Our team aims to help the NYC government to:** 

● relieve the stress of the call center 

● allocate public resources efficiently 

● maintain quality of service by incorporating tools such as call automation. 

● Help managers, and executives make informed decisions
